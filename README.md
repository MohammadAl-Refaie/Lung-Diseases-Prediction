# Lung-Diseases-Prediction

This project uses a pre-trained MobileNet model to classify lung diseases from chest X-ray images.
It distinguishes between three classes:

1- Normal

2- Lung Opacity

3- Viral Pneumonia

A user-friendly GUI built with Tkinter allows users to upload chest X-ray images and instantly receive predictions, confidence scores, and the displayed image.

📌 Features:

1- Deep Learning (MobileNet) 🧠

- Transfer learning using MobileNet (ImageNet pre-trained)

- Custom top layers for 3-class classification

- Enhanced image preprocessing

- Data augmentation applied to training set

- 91% accuracy achieved

2- Desktop GUI 🖥️

- Built using Tkinter

- Upload any chest X-ray image

- Real-time model prediction

3- Displays:

- Predicted class

- Confidence percentage

- The X-ray image
